HealSmart offers a comprehensive healthcare solution by leveraging modern technologies and user-friendly design principles. The architecture is built around three main divisions:

1. **Symptom Analysis:** HealSmart diagnoses diseases based on symptoms using a Flask API connected to a trained ML model. The predicted disease is received as a response from the API, and then it guides users to the appropriate specialist doctor for further consultation. Additionally, there's an AI-driven chatbot, developed using the Gemini API, which offers preliminary suggestions based on the symptoms and disease.
2. **Mind-Bot:** To address mental health concerns(Lumi), I developed a chat application powered by the Gemini API from Google AI Studio. The Gemini 1.5 pro model is feeded with system instructions and given a perona and trained with some conversations to provide empathetic consultations. This chatbot provides support for mental health issues like loneliness and anxiety and also offers suggestions on how to handle them effectively.
3. **Consult Doctor:** HealSmart enables users to find and book appointments with doctors across various specialties. Data is fetched from Firebase Firestore, where dummy healthcare provider datas are maintained. Users can explore doctors' profiles, view their basic details and ratings, and check for their availability. This feature streamlines the process of finding and scheduling appointments, enhancing the overall healthcare experience for users.
